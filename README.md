This is a repository I made for tinkering with game prototypes using the Pygame module, and to help my friends learn how to code in Python.

Considering one of the reasons I made this repository was to help friends learn how to code in Python, I made a "programming_basics.txt" file that is included in this repository.  It details how to get set up with a basic IDE and programming environment (VSC, Python, Git Bash, virtualenv).

If you have any recommendations or fix requests, contact the maintainer of this repository or make a pull request.
